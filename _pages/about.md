## Biography
My name is Yingtao Luo (Ying-Tao Luo, 罗颖韬). I am a third-year Ph.D. student in joint [Machine Learning and Public Policy](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/phd-students.html) program at Carnegie Mellon University, fully supported by the Presidential Fellowship and the CMLH Translational Fellowship in Digital Health from CMU. I am mainly advised by [Prof. Rema Padman](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/padman-rema) to work on sequential decision-making agent for heart failure problem and data, with the guidance and help from [Prof. Reza Skandari](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/r.skandari) and [Prof. Arman Kilic](https://providers.muschealth.org/sc/charleston/arman-kilic-md). Before joining CMU, I primarily work with [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) at Tsinghua University, [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://john-qiangliu.tech/) at CASIA and many other wonderful people. I also worked at Damo Academy of Alibaba and Microsoft Research Asia for research intern. 

I am very grateful so far for all the great people from whom I learn a lot and get a lot of support. Their impacts have really shaped and transformed who I am now.

## Methodology Interest
Decision Making: Learning agent that collaborates with experts to make medical decisions.  
Foundation Model: Large language model and multimodal model for healthcare informatics.  

## Domain Interest
Health, Science (scientific basis for health).

## Statement
I am more attracted to real-world impact and how people's lives can be improved directly (one of the reasons I quit physics, alas), while truly enjoying exposing myself to core ML theory. I am generally open to collaboration and enjoy working with talented people I have met so far. 

## Skillset
Mostly about core ML (statistics, convex optimization, graphical model, reinforcement learning, etc.) and coding with Pytorch and CUDA, but also have the pleasure to learn human decision bias, healthcare informatics to aid my research.
