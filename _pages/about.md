## Biography
My name is Yingtao Luo (Ying-Tao Luo, 罗颖韬). I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in joint [Machine Learning and Public Policy](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/phd-students.html) program (with [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/) and [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/)) at Carnegie Mellon University. My advisory committee members are [Prof. Rema Padman](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/padman-rema) at CMU, [Prof. Reza Skandari](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/r.skandari) at Imperial College London, [Prof. Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/) at CMU, and [Prof. Arman Kilic](https://providers.muschealth.org/sc/charleston/arman-kilic-md) at MUSC. Before joining CMU, I primarily work with [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) at Tsinghua University, [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://john-qiangliu.tech/) at CASIA and many other wonderful people. I also worked at Damo Academy of Alibaba and Microsoft Research Asia for research intern. 

I am very grateful for my collaborators and all the other great people from whom I learn a lot and get a lot of support. Their impacts have really shaped and transformed who I am now.
